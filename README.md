<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Mental illness can be a burden for those whose lives are impacted from it, es-pecially those with serious mental illness. This burden is exasperated whenmultiple mental illnesses co-occur - a phenomenon known as psychiatric co-morbidity (further referred to as comorbidity). Recently, the field of psycho-metric analysis,  or the analysis of psychological measurement techniquesand theories, has had two major perspectives of how two analyze comorbid-ity:  the latent variable perspective and the network perspective.  We extendCramer et.  al.â€™s (2010) initial hypothesis of the usability of network analy-sis to latent network path analysis, identifying pathways of comorbidity toidentify causal symptoms of disorders. We will do this in a multi-stage pro-duction. First, we will develop networks of individuals in the NCSR buildingdirected graphs based on the onset age of symptoms.  Then, we will com-bine all of the networks for individuals with a comorbid diagnoses using theDeep Graph Library(Wang et al., 2019) (DGL). We then use the combinednetwork to identify latent symptom pathways using Graph Neural Networksusing SAGE Graphs with a backend of convolutional neural networks andLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
